# Sleepy Python

## About The Application

TODO: Write a summary of what this application is for.


## Running Sleepy Python

In order to run the application you will need Machida, Giles Sender, and the Cluster Shutdown tool. To build them, please see the [Linux](/book/getting-started/linux-setup.md) or [MacOS](/book/getting-started/macos-setup.md) setup instructions.

You will need five separate shells to run this application. Open each shell and go to the `testing/performance/apps/python/sleepy_python` directory.
